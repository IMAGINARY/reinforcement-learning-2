  "panel-2": "The AI discovers actions that have a positive <strong>reward</strong> (reaching the exit) or a negative one (stepping on lava). It tries to find a sequence of actions that maximizes the total reward.",
  "panel-3": "The AI has to <strong>exploit</strong> the best actions it has learned but also needs to <strong>explore</strong> other options to find possibly higher rewards and to adapt to a changing environment.",
  "panel-4": "You can <strong>draw your own maze</strong> and the robot will slowly learn to find the exit and to avoid dangerous areas. Experiment with leaving bonus rewards on their way to reinforce certain paths.",
